	<h1>True Property Management</h1>
	<p>
	To protect your property and your rights as a landlord- It all starts with our True licensed managers and our revolutionary true accounting and communications center that virtually logs communications with landlords and tenants alike. As a landlord, you can access all documents, statements, even run your own reports, or request us to. Know that our licensed managers will keep you in compliance with the many state laws and requirements required of you as a landlord. Know that True Property Management is on your side representing your investment and your best interest. Many of the True systems that are in place are there to protect you. Should we need to evict a tenant or represent you in court for any reason, have True confidence that we are well documented to support you winning in court.
	
	We currently manage properties all across Orange County, California. From the beaches of Newport and Huntington Beach to Costa Mesa, Irvine, Orange, Santa Ana, Tustin, Mission Viejo, and everywhere in between. Our tremendous success is the direct result of landlords like you leaving their current management for someone they can trust like True Property Management. Virtually all of our clients were once with another management company. We know and understand your pain because we interview each of our landlords to better understand their needs and make it our mission to best serve you.
